\section{Language Overview}

\subsection{Primitive Types}

\Idris{} defines several primitive types: \tTC{Int}, \tTC{Integer} and
\tTC{Float} for numeric operations, \tTC{Char} and \tTC{String} for
text manipulation, and \tTC{Ptr} which represents foreign pointers.
There are also several data types declared in the library, including
\tTC{Bool}, with values \tDC{True} and \tDC{False}.
We can declare some constants with these types. Enter the following
into a file \texttt{prims.idr} and load it into the \Idris{} interactive
environment by typing \texttt{idris prims.idr}:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{constprims}

module prims;

x : Int;
x = 42;

foo : String;
foo = "Sausage machine";

bar : Char;
bar = 'Z';

quux : Bool;
quux = False;

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{constprims}

An \Idris{} file consists of an optional module declaration (here
\texttt{module prims}) followed by an optional list of imports (none here,
however \Idris{} programs can consist of several modules, and the definitions
in each module each have their own namespace, as we will discuss shortly) and a
collection of declarations and definitions. Each definition must have a type
declaration (here, \texttt{x : Int}, \texttt{foo : String}, etc).  Each
component is separated by a semi-colon.

A library module \texttt{prelude} is automatically imported by every \Idris{} program,
including facilities for IO, arithmetic, data structures and various common
functions. The prelude defines several arithmetic and comparison operators,
which we can use at the prompt. Evaluating things at the prompt gives an
answer, and the type of the answer. For example:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{promptprim}

*prims> 6*6+6
42 : Int
*prims> x == 6*6+6
True : Bool

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{promptprim}

All of the usual arithmetic and comparison operators are defined for the primitive
types. They are overloaded using type classes, as we will discuss in section
\ref{sec:classes} and can be extended to work on user defined types.
Boolean expressions can be tested with the \texttt{if...then...else} construct:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{ifthenelse}

*prims> if (x==6*6+6) then "The answer!" else "Not the answer"
"The answer!" : String

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{ifthenelse}

\subsection{Data Types}

Data types are declared in a similar way to Haskell data types, with a similar
syntax. The main difference is that Idris syntax is not whitespace sensitive,
and declarations must end with a semi-colon. Natural numbers and lists, for 
example, can be declared as follows:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{natlist}

data Nat    = O   | S Nat;           -- Natural numbers
                                     -- (zero and successor)
data List a = Nil | (::) a (List a); -- Polymorphic lists

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{natlist}

The above declarations are taken from the standard library. Unary natural
numbers can be either zero (\texttt{O} - that's a capital letter 'o', not the digit), or
the successor of another natural number (\texttt{S k}). 
Lists can either be empty (\texttt{Nil})
or a value added to the front of another list (\texttt{x :: xs}).
In the declaration for \tTC{List}, we used an infix operator \tDC{::}. New operators
such as this can be added using a fixity declaration, as follows:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{infixcons}

infixr 7 :: ;

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{infixcons}

Functions, data constructors and type constuctors may all be given infix
operators as names. They may be used in prefix form if enclosed in brackets,
e.g. (::). Infix operators can use any of the symbols:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{infixsyms}

:+-*/=_.?|&><!@$%^~.

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{infixsyms}

\subsection{Functions}

Functions are implemented by pattern matching, again using a similar syntax to
Haskell. The main difference is that \Idris{} requires type declarations for all
functions, using a single colon \texttt{:} (rather than
Haskell's double colon \texttt{::}). Some natural number arithmetic functions can be
defined as follows, again taken from the standard library:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{natfns}

-- Unary addition
plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat;
plus O     y = y;
plus (S k) y = S (plus k y);

-- Unary multiplication
mult : Nat -> Nat -> Nat;
mult O     y = O;
mult (S k) y = plus y (mult k y);

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{natfns}

The standard arithmetic operators \texttt{+} and \texttt{*} are also overloaded for
use by \texttt{Nat}, and are implemented using the above functions.
Unlike Haskell, there is no restriction on whether types and function names
must begin with a capital letter or not. Function names (\tFN{plus} and \tFN{mult} above),
data constructors (\tDC{O}, \tDC{S}, \tDC{Nil} and \tDC{::}) and type 
constructors (\tTC{Nat} and \tTC{List}) are
all part of the same namespace.

We can test these functions at the Idris prompt:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{fntest}

Idris> plus (S (S O)) (S (S O))
S (S (S (S O))) : Nat
Idris> mult (S (S (S O))) (plus (S (S O)) (S (S O)))
S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S O))))))))))) : Nat

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{fntest}

Like arithmetic operations, integer literals are also overloaded using type classes, 
meaning that we can also test the functions as follows:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{fntest}

Idris> plus 2 2 
S (S (S (S O))) : Nat
Idris> mult 3 (plus 2 2)
S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S O))))))))))) : Nat

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{fntest}

You may wonder, by the way, why we have unary natural numbers when our
computers have perfectly good integer arithmetic built in. The reason is
primarily that unary numbers have a very convenient structure which is easy to
reason about, and easy to relate to other data structures as we will see later.
Nevertheless, we do not want this convenience to be at the expense of
efficiency. Fortunately, \Idris{} knows about the relationship between
\tTC{Nat} (and similarly structured types) and numbers, so optimises the
representation and functions such as \tFN{plus} and \tFN{mult}.

\subsection{Dependent Types}

\subsubsection{Vectors}

A standard example of a dependent type is the type of ``lists with length'',
conventionally called vectors in the dependent type literature. In \Idris{},
we declare vectors as follows:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vect}

data Vect : Set -> Nat -> Set where
   Nil  : Vect a O
 | (::) : a -> Vect a k -> Vect a (S k);

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vect}

Note that we have used the same constructor names as for \tTC{List}. Ad-hoc
name overloading such as this is accepted by \Idris{}, provided that the names
are declared in different namespaces (in practice, normally in different modules).
Ambiguous constructor names can normally be resolved from context.

This declares a family of types, and so the form of the declaration is rather
different from the simple type declarations above. We explicitly state the type
of the type constructor \tTC{Vect} - it takes a type and a \tTC{Nat} as an
argument, where \tTC{Set} stands for the type of types. We say that \tTC{Vect}
is \emph{parameterised} by a type, and \emph{indexed} over \tTC{Nat}. Each
constructor targets a different part of the family of types. \tDC{Nil} can only
be used to construct vectors with zero length, and \tDC{::} to constructor
vectors with non-zero length.

We can define functions on dependent types such as \tTC{Vect} in the same way
as on simple types such as \tTC{List} and \tTC{Nat} above, by pattern matching.
The type of a function over \tTC{Vect} will describe what happens to the
lengths of the vectors involved. For example, \tFN{app}, defined in the
library, appends two \tTC{Vect}s:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vapp}

app : Vect A n -> Vect A m -> Vect A (n + m);
app Nil       ys = ys;
app (x :: xs) ys = x :: app xs ys;

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vapp}

The type of \tFN{app} states that the resulting vector's length will be the sum of
the input lengths. If we get the definition wrong in such a way that this does
not hold, \Idris{} will not accept the definition. For example:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vapperr}

app : Vect a n -> Vect a m -> Vect a (n + m);
app Nil       ys = ys;
app (x :: xs) ys = x :: app xs xs; -- BROKEN

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vapperr}

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vapperrmsg}

$ idris app.idr --check 
app.idr:3:Can't unify Vect a m with Vect a (plus n m)

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vapperrmsg}
%$

This error message suggests that there is a length mismatch between two vectors.
Note that the terms in the error message have been \emph{normalised}, so in
particular \texttt{n + m} has been reduced to \texttt{plus n m}.

\subsubsection{The Finite Sets}

Finite sets, as the name suggests, are sets with a finite number of elements.
They are declared as follows (again, in the prelude):

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{findecl}

data Fin : Nat -> Set where
   fO : Fin (S k)
 | fS : Fin k -> Fin (S k);

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{findecl}

\tDC{fO} is the zeroth element of a finite set with \texttt{S k} elements; 
\texttt{fS n} is the
\texttt{n+1}th element of a finite set with \texttt{S k} elements. 
\tTC{Fin} is indexed by a \tTC{Nat}, which
represents the number of elements in the set. Obviously we can't construct an
element of an empty set, so neither constructor targets \texttt{Fin O}.

A useful application of the \tTC{Fin} family is to represent numbers with
guaranteed bounds. For example, the following function which looks up an element in a \tTC{Vect}
is defined in the prelude:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vlookup}

lookup : Fin n -> Vect a n -> a;
lookup fO     (x :: xs) = x;
lookup (fS k) (x :: xs) = lookup k xs;

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vlookup}

This function looks up a value at a given location in a vector. The location is
bounded by the length of the vector (\texttt{n} in each case), so there is no
need for a run-time bounds check. The type checker guarantees that the location
is no larger than the length of the vector.

Note also that there is no case for \texttt{Nil} here. This is because it is
impossible. Since there is no element of \texttt{Fin O}, and the location is a
\texttt{Fin n}, then \texttt{n} can not be \tDC{O}.  As a result, attempting to
look up an element in an empty vector would give a compile time type error,
since it would force \texttt{n} to be \tDC{O}.
