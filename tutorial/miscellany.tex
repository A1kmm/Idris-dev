\section{Miscellany}

Small things which don't quite fit elsewhere:

\begin{itemize}
\item Namespaces (other than modules)
\item Literate programming
\item Totality checking
\item Foreign functions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison}

How does \Idris{} compare with other dependently typed languages and proof
assistants, such as Coq, Agda and Epigram?
