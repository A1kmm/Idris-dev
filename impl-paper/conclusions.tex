\section{Discussion}

\label{sect:discussion}

Since we have used a tactic-based EDSL to elaborate \Idris{} to \TT{}, it makes
sense to expose the tactic language to the programmer.
Also tactic-implicit arguments as a generalisation of instance resolution.

Discuss performance (anecdotally, how big is the library and how long to check,
and relative to previous version). 

\subsection{Related Work}

Oleg~\cite{McBride1999} as inspiration. \Epigram{}~\cite{McBride2004a}.
How does Agda~\cite{norell2007thesis} work?
Earlier \Idris{}, with \Ivor{}~\cite{Brady2006b}.

Comparison with GHC's type system and type checker.

\subsection{Conclusion}

[Observation: separate elaboration and type checking, sort of like in GHC which
type checks the high level language and produces a type correct core language.
Elaboration is effectively a type checker for the high level language, so we have
a hope of providing reasonable error messages related to the original code.]


\subsection{Further Work}

[Would the EDSL approach work in other languages? Adding components of DTP
to imperative languages, say, using \TT{} as a verified core.
\Idris{} implementation as the beginning of a project to explore practical
DTP --- systems, protocols, security especially. And just having full
dependent types for lightweight correctness guarantees.]
