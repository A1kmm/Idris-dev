Comparison with GHC's type system and type checker.

\section{Conclusion}

[Observation: separate elaboration and type checking, sort of like in GHC which
type checks the high level language and produces a type correct core language.
Elaboration is effectively a type checker for the high level language, so we have
a hope of providing reasonable error messages related to the original code.]
