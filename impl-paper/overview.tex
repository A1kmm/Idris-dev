\section{overview}

High level view of steps we've taken to implement this new version:

\begin{itemize}
\item Syntax tree for raw and well-typed terms
\item An evaluator for well-typed terms
\item The important bit: a simple type checker. No unification or
  inference.
\item The proof state and a tactic engine (Oleg style~\cite{mcbride-thesis}).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dealing with names: typechecking and evaluation in a context, managing de Bruijn
        indices becomes tricky.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For the high level language: we need nothing more than the core type theory,
and a way of putting stuff together. So we typecheck each pattern match clause
individually, in an appropriate context. There is no need for the core type
theory to have pattern matching.
