\section{overview}

High level view of steps we've taken to implement this new version:

\begin{itemize}
\item Syntax tree for raw and well-typed terms
\item An evaluator for well-typed terms
\item The important bit: a simple type checker. No unification or
  inference.
\item The proof state and a tactic engine.
\end{itemize}
