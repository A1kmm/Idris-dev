FunErrTest.idr:43:10:When elaborating right hand side of problem1:
FunErrTest.cadr requires that its argument contain at least two elements. This fails because:  
	There is no proof that xs is non-empty.

Original error:

	Can't unify
		True = True
	with
		isCons xs = True
	
	Specifically:
		Can't unify
			True
